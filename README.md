# tadFindingPrototypes
Amir Alavi's rotation work for Kingsford Group, Fall 2016

A description of the work is given in the included PDF file.

The HiC input matrices and Dixon domains were taken from http://chromosome.sdsc.edu/mouse/hi-c/download.html

The Armatus domains for chromosome 1 were generated by running Armatus on the Dixon data (https://github.com/kingsfordgroup/armatus)

The code for calculating Variation of Information (VI) was written by Natalie Sauerwald (vi_v2.m)
